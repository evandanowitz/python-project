# Recipe App (Command Line Version)

## Project Deliverables
### Exercise 1.1: Intro to Python Programming
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use pip to install and manage packages
#### What Did I Do?
- Install Python `3.8.7` on my system
- Created a new virtual environment called `cf-python-base`: `mkvirtualenv cf-python-base`
- Created a project directory folder called `python-project-1`
- Added a file called `add.py` and defined two variables as well as a function that stores the values of the two variables in a third variable. Then, I printed that variable (`c`) to the console
- Set up an IPython shell in the `cf-python-base` virtual environment (like the regular Python REPL): `pip3.8 install ipython`
- Verified the installation of IPython by launching an IPython shell: `ipython`
- Exported a `requirements.txt file`: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Created a new virtual environment called `cf-python-copy` and installed packages from the `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Created a GitHub repo for the project and made my commits and published the branch.
- Created and documented a README.md file
- Started a learning journal
