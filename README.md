# Recipe App (Command Line Version)

## Objective
To build the command line version of a Recipe application, which acts as a precursor to its web app counterpart in Achievement 2.

## Context
This project primarily focuses on implementing Python fundamentals, data structures, and object-oriented programming. It also incorporates and interacts with databases using Python as well as promote standard programming practices that make the code simpler, more readable, and more robust during execution.

## User Goals
1. Users should be able to create, view and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app.
2. Users should be able to search for recipes by their ingredients.
3. Users should be able to delete recipes.

## Key Features
- Create and manage the user's recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
- Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.
- Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty of the recipe.

## Technical Requirements
- The app handles any common exceptions or errors that may pop up either during user input, database access, for example, and display user-friendly error messages.
- The app connects to a MySQL database hosted locally on your system.
- The app provides an easy-to-use interface, supported by simple forms of input and concise instructions that any user can follow (e.g., instead of having them manually type in the option, list the options with numbers, and have them enter the number corresponding to their choice).
- The app works on Python 3.6+ installations.
- App code is well-formatted according to standardized guidelines.
- App code is supported by concise, helpful comments that illustrate the flow of the program.
- The app handles any kind of input from the userâ€“assume that your user would enter random, nonsensical inputs.

## Project Deliverables
### Exercise 1.1: Intro to Python Programming
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use `pip` to install and manage packages

### Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their own internal data
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

### Exercise 1.3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
- Create your first script on a `.py` script file
- Build a script that uses `if-elif-else` statements, `for` loops, and functions to take recipes from the user, then display them

### Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python
- Create a Python script that takes recipes from the user and writes the data in a binary file
- Create another script that reads the binary file and lists out the available ingredients. The user chooses an ingredient and the script displays all recipes which contain it
- Use Python's exception handling features to handle common errors

### Exercise 1.5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Build a custom class for your recipes, which contains its own data attributes for name, ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, as well as other custom methods to interact with this data

### Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python
- Set up a MySQL database and connect your scripts to it
- Build an application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes recipes, as well as searching for them by a single ingredient

### Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
- Use an Object Relational Mapper from SQLAlchemy to manage the contents of your database from your application
- Build a user-friendly menu for entering and searching recipes and ingredients
- Store recipe and ingredient data in a MySQL database
- Implement recipe search according to user-defined ingredients
- Implement a detailed display of the recipe selected by the user
